# Supporting Plasma Software in the UK

PlasmaFAIR is a new community network of RSEs working in plasma
science. Our goal is to improve the quality and sustainability of
plasma research software.

We offer a free health-check of your software, including one-to-two
weeks of development effort to implement some of our sustainability
and usability recommendations.

# Software is Important

The majority of UK research relies on software, and this is especially
true in plasma science. From first principles simulations of
gyrokinetics, to data analysis of solar observations, via reaction
networks of atmospheric plasmas, we all use research software.

# How it works

0. Fill in an [application form]({{ page.hero_link}})!
1. An RSE from PlasmaFAIR will have an initial discussion with you
   about your software. This is a pretty informal chat, covering
   various aspects of both your software and the wider project. We'll
   talk about things like version control, testing, and documentation.
2. From the initial discussion, the RSE will draw up a list of
   recommendations on how to improve the sustainability and usability
   of your software.
3. Out of this list of recommendations, you and the RSE will decide on
   some to do as part of the PlasmaFAIR project. We typically expect
   this project to take one to two weeks, but longer or shorter
   projects are possible.
4. After finishing the project, the RSE will write up a short report
   describing the software and the improvements we made. We'd like to
   make the reports publicly available, and add your software to our
   directory of plasma research software.


# Funding and Support
