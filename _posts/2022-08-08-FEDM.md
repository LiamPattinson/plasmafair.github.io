The FEDM project, created by Dr Aleksandar Jovanovic, is a collection of functions to
assist in the simulation of electric discharges using finite element methods. Building
on top of the  [FEniCS][FEniCS] finite element library, FEDM is able to simulate a large
number of particle species and the reactions that may occur between them during an
electrical discharge. These systems can involve a large number of source terms, some of
which may be stiff in nature, and coding these by hand can be very laborious and
error-prone. FEDM aims to simplify the development of these models.

FEniCS can be difficult to get running, in part because it has no officially maintained
Anaconda distribution; the recommended ways to obtain it are to either perform a
system-wide install using Debian's `apt` package manager, or to run all FEniCS code
within a Docker container. Complicating matters further, FEniCS has recently been
updated to version 0.4, which is not backwards compatible with the legacy versions. As
the new version is not yet widely used and may be unstable, FEDM is designed to run on
the legacy v0.3 Docker container.

The processes for getting FEDM and FEniCS to run on a Docker container were well
explained in the project README, so it was easy to start work on the library. One of the
first changes was an upgrade to allow FEDM to be installed using `pip`, allowing it to
be easily run and tested from anywhere on the system, as it previously required the user
to modify the Python path. From here, further changes were made to improve runtime error
checking, minimise repeated code, and refactor in cases where the control flow was
unclear. The provided examples were also modified to create some test cases that can be
run using pytest.

A number of future upgrades should be possible for FEDM, such as a custom Docker image
that provides FEDM pre-installed alongside FEniCS. This would make it easier for others 
to use the software, and would also make it easier to automate testing using a CI
service such as Github Actions.

As of August 2022, FEDM is not a publicly accessible library, although this may change
within the year.
