`openmc-plasma-source` is a Python package that simplifies the creation of
neutron sources for [OpenMC][openmc] Monte-Carlo simulations in tokamaks. It
allows users to create point sources, ring sources, and randomised collections
of ring sources called `TokamakSource`.

The library is quite small, so it was possible to make small
improvements over the whole project. First, the Python packaging system
was updated to use the PEP [517][PEP517]/[518][PEP518] method, which requires using a `pyproject.toml` file 
and `setup.cfg` file in place of the previously-recommended `setup.py`.
Following this, the unit tests were greatly expanded to ensure all components of the
library are working as intended.
To ensure `TokamakSource` would work for a range of Tokamak geometries,
the [Hypothesis][hypothesis] library was used to test over hundreds of randomly
generated Tokamaks.

One of the most significant upgrades to the library was the introduction of input constraints
for all classes. These are used to ensure that variables passed to a class's `__init__` function
are of the expected type, and to prevent the undefined behaviour that may result if, for example,
a negative major radius were used to initialise a class. Python [properties][properties]
are a great way to enforce these conditions, as by giving each attribute a custom
setter function, the user can avoid listing endless try/except blocks in the `__init__` 
function, and they protect against attributes being set to inappropriate values even after
initialisation.

However, the class `TokamakSource` takes a lot of inputs, and this necessitates a lot of
properties. Defining two functions -- a getter and a setter -- for each attribute is  error prone,
and it can make it confusing to navigate a Python class. To automate the process, I
wrote a small library called [proper_tea][proper_tea] which provides 'property
factories' with descriptive names such as `positive_float()`, `int_greater_than(value)`,
or `in_set(iterable)`. Properties with constraints on their setter functions can then be simply 
declared as follows:

```python
class MyClass:

    pos_int = proper_tea.positive_int()
    abc = proper_tea.in_set(["A","B","C"])
    
    def __init__(self, pos_int, abc):
        self.pos_int = pos_int
        self.abc = abc
```

Now, If the user tries to set `pos_int` to `-5`, or `abc` is set to `"hello world"`, an exception is raised. 

After developing this, I was made aware of an existing package that does the same thing!
The [param][param] library is much more developed than `proper_tea`, and makes use of
[descriptors][descriptors] and a frightening amount of metaclassing rather than
properties. It was decided to use this instead of `proper_tea`, as it's much better
supported and is more likely to remain stable over time.

`openmc-plasma-source` is now a much more tested library, and a significant amount of
code was cleaned up during the upgrades. Using the [param][param] library, its classes
are also protected against bad inputs, and as the class attributes now behave like properties, 
they are also protected against being set to inappropriate values elsewhere in the code.
