[NetCDF][netcdf] is a popular file format in the plasma community, as its
labelled coordinate data and self-descriptive hierarchical format makes it a
great choice for scientific data. It has bindings in all of the popular
languages used in research software, including Fortran, which is heavily used in
plasma science.

I help maintain several Fortran packages that use netCDF, and I often find
myself a little frustrated with how verbose the API (application programming
interface) can be, especially for common, basic tasks like writing a variable to
file. This is usually compounded by netCDF defaulting to the "classic" file
format, rather than the more modern netCDF-4 format, which has more features, is
backed by [HDF5][hdf5] (another popular file format, with an even more verbose
API!), and is generally easier to use.

I had already written some wrappers to make my life easier for the gyrokinetic
solver [GS2][gs2], so I decided to write to tidy them up and pull them out into
a standalone package: [neasy-f][neasyf]. Neasy-f is not a complete replacement
for the netCDF-Fortran API, but is designed to be almost a "drop-in" replacement
for sets of function calls while cutting down on the amount of boilerplate
required.

Neasy-f is still in alpha (meaning it's currently subject to backwards
incompatible changes at any point), but already I've managed to cut out 300
lines from an existing project. If you use netCDF in a Fortran code, try out
neasy-f and see if can help improve the sustainability of your software!
