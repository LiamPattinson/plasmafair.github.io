[EPOCH][epoch] is a particle-in-cell (PIC) code used to simulate laser-plasma
interactions, with research applications including inertial confinement fusion,
laser wakefield acceleration, and quantum electrodynamics. However, EPOCH is
written in Fortran, which will make it difficult to optimise for next-generation
HPC architectures which will rely heavily on GPU offloading.  As a result, there
is an effort underway to reimplement EPOCH in C++ using performance-portable
frameworks.

Our work on this project was aimed at implementing a CMake build system,
testing/documentation frameworks, and continuous integration workflows.  EPOCpp
is planned to be usable either as a standalone executable or via Python
bindings, so the CMake system had to be quite flexible. We chose to use
[`scikit-build-core`][skbuild] to enable building and installing the project as
a Python library, which greatly simplified the interface between the compiled
parts of the project defined in `CMakeLists.txt` and the Python parts in
`pyproject.toml`.

Tests for the C++ portion of the code were implemented using
[GoogleTest][gtest], while the Python tests were implemented using
[pytest][pytest].  The documentation was implemented using [Doxygen][doxygen] in
C++ and [Sphinx][sphinx] in Python, and the two were bridged using the Sphinx
extension [Breathe][breathe] to provide a single consistent set of docs across
the two languages.

Finally, a series of GitHub workflows were implemented to automate building,
testing, linting, and formatting. Linting was performed using [ruff][ruff] in
Python and [clang-tidy][tidy] in C++, while formatting was performed using
[black][black] in Python and [clang-format][format] in C++.

The most difficult aspect of this project was learning to use such a large range
of tools and ensuring all of them could function across the language barrier. It
was also challenging to write the `CMakeLists.txt` files in such a way that
users and developers could have sufficient control over the build process while
also permitting multiple build strategies.
